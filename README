bash-scripts
==============================================================================

A small collection of bash script utilities:

1) gitpoll
     Periodically polls a git repo looking for a new tag; if it finds one, it
     performs a new pull.

2) indexNS2GSearch
     Indexes all the records in Fedora that have a supplied namespace; GSearch
     doesn't have a way to batch index records; this script works around that.

3) pidgin
     A simple wrapper for the Pidgin IM client, resolving issues it has with
     the Microsoft Lync plugin.

4) drupalup
     Runs a series of drush scripts to perform Drupal core updates on a series
     of Drupal sites (multisites or Drupal installs at different locations).
