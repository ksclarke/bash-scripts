================================================================================

A small collection of bash script utilities:

1) gitpoll
     Periodically polls a git repo looking for a new tag; if it finds one, it
     performs a new pull.

2) indexNS2GSearch
     Indexes all the records in Fedora that have a supplied namespace; GSearch
     doesn't have a way to batch index records so this script works around that.
