#! /bin/bash

#
# A script for indexing (in GSearch) all Fedora records in a given namespace.
#
# There are a few configurable things up front (host, port, etc.), but
# namespace and password are supplied by user when initiating the script.
#
# Usage: ./indexNS2GSearch edu.ucla.library.yourCollectionNameGoesHere
#
# Dependencies: cURL, Bash shell, and the Fedora Commons command line tools
